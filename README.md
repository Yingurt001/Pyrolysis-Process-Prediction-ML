# Pyrolysis Process Prediction with Machine Learning
**åŒ–å­¦äº§ç‰©é€†æŽ¨ä¸Žå‚¬åŒ–çƒ­è§£é¢„æµ‹æ¨¡åž‹**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the complete workflow for analyzing and predicting the yields of pyrolysis products from **cotton stalk (CS)**, **cellulose (CE)**, and **lignin (LG)** when mixed with **desulfurization ash (DSA)** catalyst. The project combines **statistical modeling** and **machine learning** to explore reaction mechanisms and improve renewable energy production efficiency.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Descriptive Statistical Analysis**: Mean, variance, and trend visualization for pyrolysis products.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation coefficients between catalyst ratio and product yield.
- **Significance Testing**: Paired-samples t-tests and two-factor ANOVA for catalyst effects.
- **Reaction Kinetics Modeling**: Three-stage pyrolysis mechanism with nonlinear regression fitting.
- **Prediction Models**:
  - Linear & Nonlinear Regression
  - Grey Prediction Model
  - Feed-Forward Neural Network
- **Visualization**: Scatter plots, line charts, stacked plots for product and gas yields.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleaning, outlier detection, and normality tests.
2. **Statistical Analysis** â€“ Exploring catalyst influence on tar, water, char, and syngas.
3. **Kinetics Modeling** â€“ Building catalytic reaction mechanisms for CE and LG.
4. **Predictive Modeling** â€“ Implementing regression, grey models, and ANN to forecast yields.
5. **Model Validation** â€“ Using RÂ², RMSE, and residual analysis for accuracy evaluation.
